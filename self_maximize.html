                <h3>First Impressions</h3>
                <p>
                    Our monkey brain likes to percieve taller people as stronger
                    and more confident. Similar to when two lobsters meet for
                    the first time, we want to see where we stand on the totem
                    pole before acting accordingly. Height is a simple and
                    straightforward indicator that we use to see if we should
                    start off our relationship from a docile or assertive
                    standpoint. When stepping to a taller person, we practice
                    caution, looking up at them, our subconscious mind is
                    telling us that this bigger creature in front of us might
                    have more <i>power</i>. We might need to tread carefully, so
                    that power is not used against us. On the other hand,
                    looking down at a shorter person, we physically stand over
                    their position. We feel safe enough to be more assertive,
                    maybe even trying to confirm our dominance over them.
                </p>
                <h3>Continued relationships</h3>
                <p>
                    Height loses its importance somewhat as we get to know a
                    person. Their other qualities, that need more time to
                    discover, come through. We might have realized that even if
                    the person is shorter than us, they assume a leading role in
                    the relationship/group via their other qualities like
                    confidence and perseverance. Still, when a new taller person
                    approaches, our monkey brain still engages the same thought:
                    "This person seems taller than the person I know, is he also
                    more X in this Y quality?"
                </p>
                <h3>⚡ Self-maximize?</h3>
                <p>
                    Stand tall, with your shoulders back. Because height is a
                    part of the <b>size</b> bias, work on becoming more muscular
                    and/or fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If <b>shorter</b>, standing closer to a taller person will
                    force you to tilt your head back more. This will emphasize
                    your <i>shortness</i>. This can be used to great advantage
                    when you want to inspire confidence in the other person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If <b>taller</b>, stand closer to a shorter person if you
                    would like to be more assertive. Be careful not to cast a
                    shadow on someone you don't want to overshadow.
